## THE SPARKS FOUNDATION TASK-1

The objective of this task is to predict the percentage of marks of a student based on the number of study hours using simple LINEAR REGRESSION ALGORITHM and it invloves just two variables.


## THE SPARKS FOUNDATION TASK-2

The objective of this task is to predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually. I used K-means algorithm here. K Means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. In this example we look at using the IRIS dataset.


## THE SPARKS FOUNDATION TASK-3

The objective of this task is to create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically using the Iris dataset. 
Decision Tree algorithm belongs to the family of supervised learning algorithms. Unlike other supervised learning algorithms, the decision tree algorithm can be used for solving regression and classification problems too.

The goal of using a Decision Tree is to create a training model that can use to predict the class or value of the target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from prior data(training data).
